            <h2>About Me</h2>
        </section>
        <p>Iâ€™m Mahmood Zuhair AC, a passionate and curious learner currently pursuing my B.Tech in Artificial Intelligence and Data Science at B.S.A. Crescent Institute of Science and Technology. With a strong academic foundation and a keen interest in technology, Iâ€™ve developed hands-on skills in Python programming, data analysis, and machine learning. I recently completed an NPTEL course in Python, which enhanced my problem-solving mindset. What makes me unique is my ability to blend logic with creativityâ€”whether itâ€™s building AI models, learning web development, or exploring real-world tech solutions. Being a sports enthusiast, I also bring teamwork, focus, and discipline into everything I do. My goal is to grow as a tech professional and one day become a successful entrepreneur.</p>

        <p>âš™ Advanced Prompting â€“ Brief Description
Advanced prompting refers to smart techniques used to give AI (like ChatGPT) clear and structured instructions to get better, more accurate, and task-specific results. Instead of asking simple questions, advanced prompts use methods like Zero-shot, Few-shot, or Chain-of-thought to guide the AI's thinking and improve output quality.

Itâ€™s especially useful in:

AI model testing

Natural Language Processing

Creative writing

Coding, translation, and more

Mastering advanced prompting helps developers, data scientists, and students use AI more effectively and efficiently.</p>

        <h3>Recipe Generator</h3>

        </li>
        <p>
            The Recipe Generator is a web-based application that allows users to create customized recipes based on selected ingredients. By using advanced prompt engineering and simple UI design, the system generates step-by-step cooking instructions for both vegetarian and non-vegetarian dishes. The goal of this project is to simplify meal planning and support creativity in the kitchen using AI-assisted suggestions.
